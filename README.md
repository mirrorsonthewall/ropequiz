<h1> ROPE Quiz </h1>

[This is a flashcard quiz program for The Plover "ROPE" 
(Remembering Outlines in Plover more Easily) System.](https://github.com/kburchfiel/rope)

Either can be run in a python interpreter or from command line with the python command;
it starts by showing a word in Plover steno, then if you hit enter it will give the
"translation" in plain english, then hitting enter again gives you a new word.
You can exit by typing q (after an English word only I think) and hitting enter.

I have also experimented with trying to make Plover more easy to visualize or learn for me, so
the "pseudosteno" file translates steno order in to condensed letters to memorize, for instance
the symbol "%" is used for "AOEU" in steno order, or "I" for "EU". A full list of what's finished
is in the source code. I am open to suggestions on what to change.
